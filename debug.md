# Debugging Notes

## Purpose of these notes
It is expected that there will be a lot of issues when first using the Xilinx and PYNQ toolchains. This markdown file aims to assist you with debugging your PYNQ board and give pointers to useful documentation / forum posts.

Feel free to provide further support to your coursemates by providing us with information of other commonly seen bugs. 

Any questions? Contact Kevin through email (khl22@ic.ac.uk), or Discord (@booth01).
