# Lab 1: Introduction to PYNQ and Vivado

## 1.1 Environment setup

### Toolchain versions

To get started with the labs, we will first setup the required toolchain - this might be a bit troublesome, so please take advantage of the debugging notes `debug.md`.

In this lab, we will use the PYNQ-Z1 board, with PYNQ image v2.7, and Vivado version 2020.2. I understand that some of you might have used different versions of Vivado before, but please download this version of Vivado as it is verified to work for a more stable version of the PYNQ image, which is v2.7.

If you encounter any issues, please first refer to the debugging notes `debug.md`, before approaching the TAs or the module leader.

Operating system requirements: Windows 10 or 11, Ubuntu Linux

- This lab was created, tested and verified on a Windows 10 laptop running the above versions of the toolchains.
- If you are using a MacOS device, options include:
  - Virtual machine (VM)
  - Using lab computers

### Vivado

Go to the following 

For limited storage issues, refer to [debug.md](../debug.md).

### PuTTY

You may have encountered PuTTY before in your work or previous modules - it is a terminal emulator that allows you to connect to a remote server. In this case, we will use PuTTY to SSH into the PYNQ board.

Note that this is not strictly necessary, as you should be able to use the Juputer Notebook interface to directly interact with your PYNQ board. However, PuTTY is useful for troubleshooting in cases where your board refuses to establish a connection.

Download PuTTY from the following link: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html
