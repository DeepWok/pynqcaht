# Lab 1: ???

## Environment setup

### Toolchain versions

To get started with the labs, we will first setup the required toolchain - this might be a bit troublesome, so please take advantage of the debugging notes `debug.md`.

In this lab, we will use the PYNQ-Z1 board, with PYNQ image v2.7, and Vivado version 2020.2 . I understand that some of you might have used different versions of Vivado before, but please download this version of Vivado as it is verified to work for a more stable version of the PYNQ image, which is v2.7.

Operating system requirements: Windows 10 / 11, Linux

Note: This lab was created, tested and verified on a Windows 10 laptop running the above versions of the toolchains.
