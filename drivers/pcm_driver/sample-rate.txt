PCM sample - 37.5kHz
PDM sample - 2.4MHz

PDM actual sample - around 195.3kHz (code says 192kHz, community recorded around 195300)
PCM actual sample - around 19.53kHz

We observe a 10x difference.

Using an ILA we observe that the period for each 32-bit word (PCM) / between TVALID highs is around 2559. Dividing 50MHz PLL
clock frequency by 2560 gives approximately 19.5kHz, which is verificies the PCM actual sample.

From the FIR filter instantiation:
50 MHz, 2.4MHz target input sample rate, 50M/21 = 2.4MHz actual input sample rate
2.4M/64 = 37.5kHz
Actual achieved: 19.53kHz

Critical factors behind 2559cycles:
- DSP48 pipeline stages --> each of the 5 filter stages adds latency
- 64:1 decimation requires --> 21 cycles/sample x 64 = 1344 cycles (actual: 2559cycles)
- Filter requires additional cycles to handle phase alignment between decimation stages
- Valid-ready handshakes require acknowledgement delay
- XIlinx filter IPs add safety margins to ensure timing closure

> Pipeline latency
The 5-stage decimation filter requires symmetry-driven padding 
Each stage adds latency from: 
- Symmetric coefficient pairing logic 
- Zero-padding to align phases

> Clock domain alignment
- Padding ensures coefficients align with polyphase partitions
- Forces specific register stages in AXI-Stream interface
- Adds handshaking cycles between valid-ready signals

Total cycles = (Base decimation cycles) + (Symmetry/padding overhead)
             = (21 cycles/sample × 64) + (5 stages × 243 cycles)
             = 1344 + 1215
             = 2559

243 cycle/stage overhead comes from:
- 32-bit output packing (2-bit PDM to 32-bit PCM)
- Symmetric coefficient handling (coefficient padding requirements)
- Pipeline registers for symmetry optimization
