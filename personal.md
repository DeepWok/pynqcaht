# Notes for writing this lab

- After finishing a section, make constant corrections and checks that you are referencing different sections properly.
- Don't be too long-winded, just like your final report writing.
- Make the lab files as visual as possible so that people can actually understand what you are trying to present.
- Reference external sources instead of going into detail for everything.
- Split the Markdown text up


## Questions for Monday meeting

- If I want to directly send API requests from the PYNQ board to the internet, then it would be troublesome since the board itself does not have a WiFi shield. Options:
  - Using a WiFi connector (failed in previous attempts during InfoProc)
  - Network forwarding from the laptop to the board (previously achieved but might confuse a lot of students)
  - Ask students to go to ICT to register their board's MAC address to the network (need to communicate with ICT)
