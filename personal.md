# Notes for writing this lab

- After finishing a section, make constant corrections and checks that you are referencing different sections properly.
- Don't be too long-winded, just like your final report writing.
- Make the lab files as visual as possible so that people can actually understand what you are trying to present.
- Reference external sources instead of going into detail for everything.
- Split the Markdown text up
