## 4.3 OpenAI API

## 4.4 gTTS



## 4.5 Wake word detection

We're almost finished with the software side of the chatbot, but we want the chatbot to be interactive, meaning that it understands when you are speaking to it. We will do a simple wake word detection using Porcupine. 

## 4.6 CAD scripting

Congrats, you've made it to the last part of the labs. Unfortunately, this section is not an easy one. You will have to design and 3D print your chatbot!
